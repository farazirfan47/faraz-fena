# Spin up your docker instance

This project runs entirely from docker. So in order to run all services first you should have docker desktop installed on your system.

Once docker desktop is installed, go to the directory of the project and run the following command: `docker compose up`. This command will download and generate the neccessary docker images, generate the required docker containers and run the project on your local machine

# Starting development

Once the project is running locally the React application will be on port 3000 (`http://localhost:3000`) while the Nest application will be using port 8000 (`http://localhost:8000`).

The entire React application is located in the `frontend` folder while the Nest application can be found inside the `backend` folder.
